# Scientific Writing with LSTM-RNN
In this project, scientific text is generated with LSTM-RNN. Training data is composed of sample text extracted from MSc/PhD thesis in nanomedicine. Seed text for predictions is taken from a separate text file.

**Examples of generated text (with citations taken out):** <br />
_"... the few classical in vitro and in vivo assays established for small molecule drugs, photosensitizers are released from liposomes and non-targeted PEG-liposomes."_ <br/>

_"... Triggered release may further increase the specific accumulation of photosensitizers to tumor area of release of photosensitizers to tumor area"_ <br/>

_"... exposed existing knowledge gaps and challenges on the scientific and technological advances over the presence of coordinating metals4 . Thus the transferrin targeted liposomes are used for systemic drug delivery capacity and biocompatibility and reduces spatial resolution of the singlet oxygen can travel is approximately 200nm ..."_ <br/>

_"... formed from the self-assemble into structures on the nanostructures for analysis methods to ensure saturation of the spectra (480-700nm), termed the Q-bands2 . For porphyrins are highly influenced by the following equation: where, QD is fluorescence imaging. Chlorin derivatives (HpDs). PhotofrinÂ® is a commercial and industrial infrastructure needed to conduct triggering mechanism, useful for PDT, to a thermal mechanism, ideal for PTT enhancement of ..."_ <br/> 

Not bad for a standard LSTM model, but still got a long way to go.
