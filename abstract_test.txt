Porphysomes are liposome-like nanovesicles formed from the self-assembly of porphyrin-lipid conjugates in an aqueous environment (Fig. 1.3). 37,89 Tens of thousands of porphyrin-lipid molecules non-covalently interact to create a lipid membrane bilayer encapsulating an aqueous core. The hydrophobic interactions among the porphyrin moieties and lipid chains create an environment of densely packed porphyrins that readily absorb light but are unable to emit it as fluorescence due to quenching. This quenching greatly promotes non-radiative vibrational heat dissipation, making intact porphysomes efficient at converting light into heat.37 However, upon dissociation the monomeric porphyrins regain their fluorescent and photodynamic properties, making the photonic properties of porphysomes highly structurally dependent. It is this combination of molecular and nanoscale properties that make porphysomes unique. Each facet of the porphysome structure presents an opportunity to be useful. Much like traditional liposomes, the outer surface of porphysomes can be outfitted to include functionalities like biomarker targeting (ligands and antibodies), macrophage evasion (PEGylation), or molecular presentation and interaction (apoproteins to cross biological barriers). Continuing the parallel with liposomes, the inner aqueous core can be utilized to entrap water soluble molecules of varying dispositions (contrast agents, tracers, drugs, etc.). The lipid bilayer is where porphysomes diverge from their liposomal cousins, the porphyrins in the apolar center of the bilayer impart inherent functionality above and beyond that of liposomes. The strong optical absorbance and near-total quenching of porphyrins in the porphysome structure make the nanoparticle a potent photothermal agent. The photothermal effect of porphysomes can be harnessed for both imaging (photoacoustic tomography, PAT) and intervention (photothermal therapy). The porphyrin-lipid building blocks themselves also provide functionality beyond the bilayer that they constitute. Dissociation of the nanoparticle, driven by changes in the environment or cell uptake, reduces the porphyrin-lipid self-quenching giving access to new modalities for visualization of (fluorescence) and treatment (photodynamic therapy) with the building blocks. One avenue of porphysome functionality has not yet been explored in full however, the ability of porphyrins to chelate metal ions. The initial porphysome report showed, as a proof-of-concept, that porphysomes could be formed from metalloporphyrin-lipids (Zn-porphyrin in this case), 37 but further study into metalloporphysomes was beyond the scope of the paper. Here, we will 9 delve into the capabilities of metalloporphysomes, investigating how the unique properties and advantages of porphysomes can be married with those of metalloporphyrins. First, with the labelling of porphysomes with radioactive 64Cu, we will demonstrate how porphysomes can easily and efficiently be converted into radiotracers for PET imaging and radiotracking. Secondly we will show how the inclusion of paramagnetic ions can allow porphysomes to affect the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) properties of surrounding water molecules, conferring MRI contrast. While there are still a myriad of other metals and modalities to be evaluated, these two studies are the first forays into the world of metalloporphysomes.
